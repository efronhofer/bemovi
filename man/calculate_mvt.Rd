\title{A function to calculate movement metrics for each trajectory}
\usage{
calculate_mvt(data, to.data, trajectory.data.folder, pixel_to_scale, fps)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{dataframe containing the X- and Y-coordinates, the frame and the trajectory ID}

\item{to.data}{path to the working directory}

\item{trajectory.data.folder}{directory where the data is saved}

\item{pixel_to_scale}{specify how a pixel scales to real dimensions}

\item{fps}{specify the frame rate of the video}
}
\value{
returns a data.table with the movement metrics for each fix appended to the original data (NB: movement metrics often need two (e.g. step length), sometimes even
three (e.g., turning angles) fixes; fixes for which metrics cannot be calculated are padded with NA). The movement parameters are the step length, the step duration,
the step speed (step length/step duration), the gross displacement as the cumulative sum of the step lengths, the net displacement between the first fix of a given trajectory
and the current fix and finally the relative angle (turning angle) and absolute angle (in radians). For details on these metrics, please refer to a dedicated textbook
(e.g. Turch (1998): Quantitative Analysis of Movement: Measuring and Modeling Population Redistribution in Animals and Plants, Sinauer Associates, Sunderland).

\description{
The function takes the X- and Y-coordinates for each unqiue trajectory and calculates movement metrics
such as the gross and net displacement, absolute and relative angles and duration
